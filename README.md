# Backbone localStorage Adapter v1.1

A localStorage adapter for Backbone.

## Usage

Include Backbone.localStorage after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.localStorage.js"></script>
```

Locally stored collections:

```javascript
var SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({

  // This collection will be stored as the array 'SomeCollection' in LocalStorage
  // Its individual models will be stored as 'SomeCollection-someid'
  localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage("SomeCollection"),

  // ... everything else is normal
});
```

Locally stored models:

```javascript
var SomeModel = Backbone.Model.extend({

  // This model will be stored as 'SomeModel-someid' in LocalStorage
  // A LocalStorage reference to it will be included in an array in 'SomeModel'
  localStorage : new Backbone.LocalStorage('SomeModel')

  // ... everything else is normal
});
```

Locally stored singletons:

```javascript
var SomeSingleton = Backbone.Model.extend({
  
  // This singleton model will always be stored as 'SomeSingleton' in LocalStorage
  // No reference array will be stored
  localStorage : new Backbone.LocalStorage('SomeModel', true)

  // ... everything else is normal
});
```
